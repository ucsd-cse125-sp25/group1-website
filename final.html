      <h1>Out of Tune: Final Report</h1>

      <h2>Project Review</h2>

      <h3>
        Game concept: To what extent did your game concept change from initial
        concept to what you implemented? If it did change, how did it change and
        why?
      </h3>
      <p></p>

      <h3>
        Design: How does your final project design compare to the initial
        design, and what are the reasons for the differences, if any?
      </h3>
      <p></p>

      <h3>
        Schedule: How does your final schedule compare with your projected
        schedule, and what are the reasons for the differences, if any? (You
        should be able to glean this from your status reports.)
      </h3>
      <p></p>

      <h2>General Questions</h2>
      <h3>
        Describe your development environment. What tools did you use? What was
        your build workflow? If you supported multiple platforms (e.g., MacOS
        and/or Linux), how did you support making your project work on all
        platforms? Do you have any tips or suggestions for future groups for
        their development environment?
      </h3>
      <p></p>

      <h3>
        What group mechanics decisions worked out well, and which ones (if any)
        did not? Why?
      </h3>
      <p></p>

      <h3>
        Which aspects of the implementation were more difficult than you
        expected, and which were easier? Why?
      </h3>
      <p></p>

      <h3>Which aspects of the project are you particularly proud of? Why?</h3>
      <p></p>

      <h3>
        What was the most difficult software problem you faced, and how did you
        overcome it (if you did)?
      </h3>
      <p></p>

      <h3>
        In developing the media content for your project, you relied upon a
        number of tools ranging from the underlying graphics libraries to
        modeling software. And you likely did some troubleshooting to make it
        all work. So that students in future years can benefit from what you
        learned, please detail your tool chain for modeling, exporting, and
        loading meshes, textures, and animations. Be specific about the tools
        and versions, any non-obvious steps you had to take to make it work
        (e.g., exporting from the tool in a specific manner), and any features
        or operations you specifically had to avoid â€” in other words, imagine
        that you were tutoring someone on how to use the toolchain you used to
        make it all work. Also, for the tools you did use, what is your opinion
        of them? Would you use them again, or look elsewhere? Are there any
        tools that you used but, looking back, you would avoid?
      </h3>
      <p></p>

      <h3>
        For those who used a networking library (e.g., RakNet or Boost), a
        physics library (e.g., Rapier or Bullet), an audio library (e.g., SFML
        or SoLoud), or a GUI library (e.g., imgui or nanovg), which libraries
        did you use and would you use them again if you were starting over
        knowing what you know now? Describe any lessons you learned using it
        (problems that you had to troubleshoot and how you addressed them) for
        future groups who may use it. If you did not use a library for any of
        those modules, judging from the experiences of the groups that did,
        would you have used it in retrospect?
      </h3>
      <p></p>

      <h3>
        How many lines of code did you write for your project? (Do not include
        code you did not write, such as library source.) Use any convenient
        mechanism for counting (e.g., scc), but state how you counted.
      </h3>
      <p></p>

      <h3>
        What lessons about group dynamics did you learn about working in such a
        large group over an extended period of time on a challenging project?
      </h3>
      <p></p>

      <h3>
        Looking back over the past 10 weeks, is there anything you would do
        differently, and what would you do again in the same situation?
      </h3>
      <p></p>

      <h3>Which courses at UCSD do you think best prepared you for CSE 125?</h3>
      <p></p>

      <h3>What advice would you give to future CSE 125 students?</h3>
      <p></p>
