        <h4>What were your contrete goals for the week?</h4>
        <p>I wanted to finish the lobby room, the swamp room, and work on character models. </p>

        <h4>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h4>
        <p>I mostly finished the lobby room, the final door is still a work in progress. I finished the swamp room, but I might come back to it later and change some textures if needed. I also still need to finish the frogs and other items for the swamp room. And I did not work on the character models this week. 
        </p>

        <h4>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons? note that this happens regularly…I would prefer you to be aggressive in what you want to try accomplish rather than limit yourself to goals you know you'll easily achieve. so answering this question is more of a reflection on the development process and the surprises you encounter, it's not at all an evaluation.</h4>
        <p>I think this week was busier for me than last week was, so I didn’t have as many hours to dedicate solely to this project and I’m starting to feel a little burnt out working on walls and floors all the time lol. I think focusing on items will be so much more fun once these room pieces are done. While I did spend a lot of time working on this project, I think a lot of it was focusing on collision boxes which is turning out to be more work than I anticipated, but shouldn’t be so time consuming once all room pieces are done. </p>

        <h4>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h4>
        <p>I really really don’t want to work on rooms anymore, therefore I want to be firm in finishing all rooms by this week. However, if it turns out that I need to prioritize other things for my teammates such as the exit door and keys then I will do that instead. I’m also kind of behind my original schedule I think, and I wanted to be working on the character and animation at this point, so starting to feel the pressure more.</p>

        <p>Goals:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Update all hotel rooms to have thicker walls</li>
            <li>Finish clown room (walls and floors and collisions)</li>
            <li>Finish piano room (walls and floors and collisions) </li>
            <li>(ideally from here I can work on character and props for all rooms)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it)?</h4>
        <p>Maybe I should’ve passed on the task of adding collisions to someone else, but at this point I’m almost done with the bulk of it so I want to finish what I started. Round room = wacky collision boxes. No more round rooms. </p>

        <h4>What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</h4>
        <p>Tired of focusing on details like numbers and naming that have to do with adding collision boxes and making rooms, but happy that I should almost be done with that and motivated to finish the last rooms. Happy that I get to see my work get put into the game. </p>

        <h4>What were your contrete goals for the week?</h4>
        <p>My concrete goals were to help finish the minigame1, start minigame2, and start thinking about how to integrate graphics with the class files.
        </p>

        <h4>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h4>
        <p>I was able to implement a lilypad class, and I worked through a death mechanic of the first minigame, with the lilypad implementing our customCollision function that Brandon implemented. I also learned a lot more from Julie’s code and we had some good discussions about how things work.</p>

        <p>This week did go differently than I had planned. I didn’t get as much work done as I had hoped. I had an incredibly busy schedule with work and family, so I didn’t finish all my work I had planned.</p>

        <h4>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h4>
        <p>Next week, I hope to finish minigame1, get the graphics implemented with it so we can actually see the gameplay, and start on minigame2.</p>

        <h4>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it)?</h4>
        <p>I learned more about the rigidbody work that Brandon has done and the codespace in general. I also learned a lot more about Julie’s code on the client/server communication.</p>

        <h4>What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</h4>
        <p>Although I didn’t get as much done as I had hoped, I am still feeling pretty good about the project. I think now that we have almost everything in place, things are going to be much quicker. I also am feeling good now that my schedule will be more free.</p>

        <h3>Graphics & Network (Julie):</h3>
        <h4>What were your contrete goals for the week?</h4>
        <p>My main goals for the week were to implement point light shadows and start working on the lobby system.</p>

        <h4>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h4>
        <p>I implemented point light shadows by creating a depth cubemap to store depth information in all directions from the light source. I used a geometry shader to render the scene from the light's perspective in six directions, sending each triangle to all six sides of the cubemap in a single pass. In the model fragment shader, I also implemented Percentage Closer Filtering (PCF) to make the shadows appear softer and more natural.</p>
        <p>Currently, the system uses one active point light per room to cast shadows, even if more lights are present. I chose to use only the shadow from the light in the current room where the player is, but I'm considering rendering shadows in nearby rooms as well (e.g. if doors are open and other rooms are visible). I'll keep adjusting based on how it looks and performs.</p>
        <p>Beyond shadows, I added the FMOD dependency for audio and updated the CMake files accordingly. Also, I added a couple of directional lights to improve the overall visuals. I also refactored the Esc key handling to use a GLFW callback for toggling mouse lock instead of polling. Additionally, I added a bounding box toggle (Shift + B)–when enabled, only bounding boxes are shown; when disabled, only the models are rendered. The arrow keys and WASD input still use polling for smoother movement.</p>
        <p>I also started working on the swamp room and adjusted some fragment shader values to better match its mood and atmosphere. It's still a work in progress.</p>
        <p>For the lobby page, I decided to hold off on the networking part until Gabriel finishes the basic UI. Since it includes user actions like choosing characters and pressing “ready,” having the UI first will make it much easier to implement and test.</p>

        <p>I thought I would have more time for the project this week, but ended up having limited time due to other responsibilities and a family event. That said, I know I could've made more progress if I had pushed myself harder. I learned that time can slip away quickly if I'm not actively managing it, and I want to stay more conscious of that going forward.</p>

        <h4>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h4>
        <p>There's one part of the code that might cause issues later, so I'll fix it first.</p>
        <p>Currently, the bounding box mode toggles between showing models or their bounding boxes, but the players are always visible. I plan to update it so that player bounding boxes are also rendered dynamically, using their minCorner and maxCorner values. Brandon will work on updating those values in real time as players rotate (to improve collision detection), so I'll make sure the visual representation reflects that.</p>
        <p>After that, I'll continue improving the swamp room–I'm using a separate fragment shader and experimenting with shadows and lighting specific to that room to match the atmosphere. I'll also make the swamp water look transparent.</p>
        <p>Jasmine plans to add light-based items, so I'll implement a bloom effect to make them glow visually and position point lights accordingly.</p>
        <p>I'll mainly be finalizing the shadows and lighting setups for both the swamp room and the hotel room. I'll also start thinking about how animations will work and how dynamic map generation will tie into the graphics–for example, if two rooms are next to each other, which one should own the shared door, and how that might affect the room layout.</p>

        <h4>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it)?</h4>
        <p>I realized ten weeks is actually pretty short. It's time to lock in.</p>

        <h4>What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</h4>
        <p>I really enjoy working on this project and love collaborating with my team. I want to get a lot done this week, because the last thing I want is to be stressed or rushed in the final week. I'm fully aware of how much work we still have left, and I'm motivated to work hard.</p>
