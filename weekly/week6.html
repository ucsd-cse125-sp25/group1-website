        <!-- Julie -->
        <h3>Network (Julie):</h3>
        <h4>What were your contrete goals for the week?</h4>
        <p>The main goals for this week were to implement the rigid body pipeline, set up the room layout hierarchically, load models and textures as soon as they’re ready, and add lighting and shadows.</p>

        <h4>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h4>
        <p>I accomplished all of my goals this week except for adding shadows.</p>
        <p>First, I implemented a game timer on the networking side. Once all four clients are connected, the timer starts ticking and broadcasts the remaining time to each client every second. If a client disconnects, the timer continues running. When all clients disconnect, the timer stops and resets for the next round. It restarts automatically once four clients reconnect. This was implemented using boost::asio::steady_timer, which triggers every second.</p>
        <p>Next, I set up a model hierarchy with parent-child relationships. Since our map generation will be dynamic, we needed to treat each room as a self-contained unit. I created a ModelInstance struct that contains a pointer to the model (since some models are reused), a local transform, and links to its parent and children. This allowed each object in a room to be positioned relative to the room itself. When rendering a room, we recursively render all its children, and each child computes its world position based on its parent's transform.</p>
        <p>I also loaded the door mesh and textures that Jasmine created.</p>
        <p>After that, I added the initial rigid body layout within a room and built a rigid body initialization pipeline. I created a JSON file that defines the bounding box layout for each room. I manually populated this data, and on the server side, I load the file and construct each bounding box in a loop.</p>
        <p>Finally, I implemented point lighting and Blinn-Phong shading. I extracted additional material information from the .obj file using Assimp, such as specular reflectivity and shininess. By combining those values with the halfway vector (between light and view directions), I was able to implement Blinn-Phong lighting. I'm still experimenting and refining this part.</p>

        <p>I anticipated that I wouldn't get a lot of coding done this week due to other responsibilities (midterm, tutoring, research, club work, etc.). What I didn't expect, however, was how much time would go into coordinating with Brandon.</p>
        <p>Originally, I manually created the JSON file for the bounding box layout within a room. Since the layout was static and Jasmine structured the OBJ files in a consistent format, I could extract the min and max corners very quickly–just by reading the 8 vertex positions. Entering each model's data took less than 10 seconds and required no calculations. The server would then read this file in a loop and construct the rigid bodies accordingly. I thought the process was straightforward and quick, especially since we had to manually define object positions within each room anyway.</p>
        <p>Brandon suggested extracting the min and max corners programmatically instead. While I initially felt this added unnecessary complexity and an extra file, we discussed the tradeoffs and various small design details. In the end, we compromised and arrived at a solution that worked for both of us. Although this process took more time than expected, I believe the discussion was important for effective teamwork.</p>

        <h4>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h4>
        <p>I'll continue working on soft shadows using Percentage Closer Filtering (PCF). If any emissive objects are ready, I'll extract their emission values and add a bloom effect. I also plan to load more models as they become available. On the networking side, I'll start implementing the lobby page.</p>

        <h4>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it)?</h4>
        <p>This week, I learned how to communicate through disagreements in a supportive and constructive way. The disagreement happened because we both really cared about the project, and talking it through helped us understand each other's perspectives better. I also got to talk a lot with Ravi–we asked each other questions while going through each other's code, and now I feel like I understand the mini-games much better.</p>

        <h4>What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</h4>
        <p>I really appreciate our team–everyone is passionate and supportive, and I feel like we're all learning a lot together through this project. I should have more time this week, so I'm planning to get a lot done.</p>
