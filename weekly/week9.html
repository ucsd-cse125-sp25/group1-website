      <h2>Group Morale</h2>
      <p>Overall, the group morale seems to be nervous yet excited. We know there is still a lot left to do, but we are determined to get it done. It should be an exciting finish to the quarter, even if not everything gets finished to the degree we had envisioned.</p>

      <h3>General Game Implementation and Mini Games (Ravi):</h3>
      <h4>What were your contrete goals for the week?</h4>
      <p>My goals were to get minigame 2 a good portion of the way done and start working on some of the other normal rooms to create parkour challenges.</p>

      <h4>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h4>
      <p>I was able to add the death mechanism with the cannonballs, work out most of the general boilerplate logic, get a basic key mechanism working to test out the parkour, and start working (still working out the kinks) on the logic to have a key appear once all 4 players are in the lobby, this way the game can only start once everyone is there.</p>

      <p>Overall the week went pretty well, and although I still don’t have the visuals for the minigame 2, I’m a lot more confident with how everything slots together in the code base, so I am able to add in graphics much faster once we have the obj files. </p>

      <h4>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h4>
      <p>Next week, I hope to have minigame 2 finished, and hopefully be halfway through minigame 3. That said, if we can’t finish minigame 3 in time, I do think it will still be a fun game. Minigame 3 is definitely the most complex. I also hope to finish up some of the parkour rooms, especially once we have more furniture models and the circus room asset.</p>

      <h4>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it)?</h4>
      <p>I learned a lot about how to use the `dimensions` and `layout` json files, and how they interact with the init rigid body functions. I also learned how to connect everything with the positioning and graphics on the client, so we have the rigid bodies the same dimensions and locations as the graphics.</p>

      <h4>What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</h4>
      <p>I am feeling pretty good about the project. I know these next ~2 weeks will be a ton of work, but I am feeling good about being able to quickly add in features now. It feels like everything finally makes sense and I am able to work with all aspects of what I am working to implement.</p>

      <h4>What were your contrete goals for the week?</h4>
      <p>The goal for this week from last week was to finish the first mini game and hopefully get started on the new mini game.</p>

      <h4>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h4>
      <p>Since the last report the first final game game play was completed but completed before our Tuesday afternoon meeting. Added in a bypass logic for the swamp mini game which if the config variable for bypass is set then the bypass rigid body is added into the the swamp minigmae for the player to just run across the room without needing to jump aorund the lilypads</p>

      <h4>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons? note that this happens regularly…I would prefer you to be aggressive in what you want to try accomplish rather than limit yourself to goals you know you’ll easily achieve. so answering this question is more of a reflection on the development process and the surprises you encounter, it’s not at all an evaluation.</h4>
      <p>Most of my progress happened on Tuesday and Thursday which the Tuesday progress was actually mentioned in our Tuesday afternoon meeting. I also had a presentation due Monday of Week 9 so I was focused on finishing the presentation and went home for memorial day. So much less progress than anticipated and desired. But I have no other dues for the rest of my classes left which means other than my club stuff I can zone in on the game.</p>

      <p>Another thing is for the swamp mini game what is missing is just the audio logic which the audio engine was merged in and then now just waiting on the frog model and the interaction logic which I believe the interaction logic was merged in mid week so will incorporate it soon.</p>

      <h4>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h4>
      <p> Add in the audio logic and interaction for the swamp minigame</p>

      <h4>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it)?</h4>
      <p> Learning wise thoughing majorly knowledge wise but when discussing the actual audio and game play of the swamp, I learned along with other members of our group that we were listening to it differently. Like for half of the group we have 8 steps in 9 notes for our game the other half would take 9 steps with 9 notes. We decided on just giving more detailed instructions on how to listen to the audio to get the desired result.</p>

      <h4>What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</h4>
      <p> Happy that the swamp game is pretty much playable now. But definately feeling the time crunch. Hoping to put in a few more binge work sessions for cse 125 for the rest of the quarter before the demo.</p>
