      <h3> General Game Implementation and Mini Games (Helen Lin): </h3>
      <h4>What were your contrete goals for the week?</h4>
      <p>The goal for this week from last week was to finish the first mini game and hopefully get started on the new mini game.</p>

      <h4>What goals were you able to accomplish?</h4>
      <p>Since the last report the first final game game play was completed but completed before our Tuesday afternoon meeting. Added in a bypass logic for the swamp mini game which if the config variable for bypass is set then the bypass rigid body is added into the the swamp minigmae for the player to just run across the room without needing to jump aorund the lilypads</p>

      <h4>If the week went differently than you had planned, what were the reasons? note that this happens regularly…I would prefer you to be aggressive in what you want to try accomplish rather than limit yourself to goals you know you’ll easily achieve. so answering this question is more of a reflection on the development process and the surprises you encounter, it’s not at all an evaluation.</h4>
      <p>Most of my progress happened on Tuesday and Thursday which the Tuesday progress was actually mentioned in our Tuesday afternoon meeting. I also had a presentation due Monday of Week 9 so I was focused on finishing the presentation and went home for memorial day. So much less progress than anticipated and desired. But I have no other dues for the rest of my classes left which means other than my club stuff I can zone in on the game.</p>

      <p>Another thing is for the swamp mini game what is missing is just the audio logic which the audio engine was merged in and then now just waiting on the frog model and the interaction logic which I believe the interaction logic was merged in mid week so will incorporate it soon.</p>

      <h4>What are your specific goals for the next week?</h4>
      <p> Add in the audio logic and interaction for the swamp minigame</p>

      <h4>What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it)?</h4>
      <p> Learning wise thoughing majorly knowledge wise but when discussing the actual audio and game play of the swamp, I learned along with other members of our group that we were listening to it differently. Like for half of the group we have 8 steps in 9 notes for our game the other half would take 9 steps with 9 notes. We decided on just giving more detailed instructions on how to listen to the audio to get the desired result.</p>

      <h4>What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</h4>
      <p> Happy that the swamp game is pretty much playable now. But definately feeling the time crunch. Hoping to put in a few more binge work sessions for cse 125 for the rest of the quarter before the demo.</p>
