      <h2>Project Description</h2>

      <h3>Game Overview</h3>

      <h4>Description</h4>

      <h5>What kind of game are you planning to build?</h5>
      <p>
        Escape room style, cooperative game with a music and horror theme. Each
        level contains multiple rooms that may contain minigames or keys.
        Players must find and collect keys and bring them to the exit door in
        order to escape to the next level.
      </p>

      <h4>Objective</h4>

      <h5>
        What are the goals of the game, how do players win, how do they lose?
      </h5>
      <p>
        The objective is to find the keys to unlock the door to escape the
        level. Each level has a time limit. If the players do not escape the
        level within the time limit, they lose the game. If they escape within
        the time limit, they win. Each time a player dies, that player must wait
        a certain amount of time before they can respawn in the level.
      </p>

      <h4>Unique Aspects</h4>

      <h5>What are the interesting or unique aspects to your game?</h5>
      <p>
        Our game will blend minigames, co-op, and music with an unsettling
        atmosphere and charming characters. It’ll throw players into a world of
        horror, but it encourages them to face it light-heartedly with its
        cooperative gameplay and goofy characters. This game will be self-aware:
        it embraces the contradictory joy of being in scary scenarios when you
        have people to laugh at.
      </p>

      <p>
        We will aim to keep our game replayable by choosing minigames that are
        also skill-based so that once you know the solution, they are still fun
        to play → don’t make one-trick puzzles that are uninteresting the second
        time around. Some minigames will also require collaboration between 2-4
        players and cannot be completed without them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Players also will be faced with music challenges that are reflective of
        real music theory practices.
      </p>

      <h2>Group Management</h2>
      <h3>Team Members</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Julie Hong</li>
        <li>Gabriel Ikezaki</li>
        <li>Helen Lin</li>
        <li>Brandon Reponte</li>
        <li>Ravi Shende</li>
        <li>Jasmine Vodhanel</li>
        <li>Annie Wong</li>
        <li>William Zhang</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Roles</h3>
      <p>
        We will not have any different leaders or group managers, because we
        will function as a democracy. However, we will still have different
        roles in game development.
      </p>

      <h3>Decision Making</h3>
      <p>
        For large game decisions, we will make decisions as a democracy, with a
        majority (5 people out of 8) needed. For smaller architectural
        decisions, it will be up to the groups that are working those pieces.
      </p>

      <h3>Decision Making</h3>
      <p>

        decisions, it will be up to the groups that are working those pieces.
      </p>

      <h3>Communication and Collaboration</h3>
      <p>
        We will communicate online using discord and zoom. We created a discord
        server where we’ll text decisions, recaps, resources, and also ping when
        necessary. We plan on using lectures for in-person full team meetings.
        Sub-groups will also decide when and how their members will meet
        throughout the week for group-specific decisions and meetings, be it in
        person or online.
      </p>

      <h3>Scheduling</h3>
      <p>
        Throughout the week, each person will check against the schedule below
        and make sure that tasks are being completed to schedule. If we see that
        we’re behind on any part, we can have people volunteer to help others in
        need. If everyone is behind, we will meet to talk about narrowing our
        scope.
      </p>

      <p>
        We will have full-group in-person meetings during each lecture. Then,
        sub-groups will have meetings either in person or on zoom at their
        discretion.
      </p>

      <h3>Weekly Group Status Reports</h3>
      <p>
        Each person will send updates of how they are doing and if they are on
        track in a discord channel for updates and brief checking on updates
        when we meet up. We will have a person taking notes of what happens
        during the meetings. We each will write our respective portions of the
        project, send it to one person that will check and make sure that
        everything is ready and completed by deadline.
      </p>

    </a>
  </li>
</ul>

    <h3> Testing</h3>
    <p>For testing, we plan on relying on Github Actions to maintain functionality of smaller codebase fragments. For each minigame, we’ll test the player’s inputs, their outputs, failure and success in respect to the minigame’s winning condition. We will do play-tests before merging each branch.
For play-tests, we will create a checklist of checks to do, adding onto it as more features are implemented.
</p>

    <h3> Documentation</h3>
    <p>We will create google docs for all player documentation (how to play, strategies, etc.) as well as internal documentation (project specifications, meeting notes, branching strategies, etc.). Those will be done as an entire group and stored in a shared google folder. All code-related specs and ADRs and information will be put on the repository.</p>

    <p>
Everyone will do documentation for the code that they write. Subgroups will do documentation for the main components that they work on. Everyone is expected to write the doc-strings for the functions that they write. File doc-strings will be written by the people who are working on that file and creating it.
</p>

    <h2>Project Schedule</h2>
    <p>Define a set of milestones with a specific definition of what each milestone is, what it means to complete each milestone, and when you expect to complete them. Define the milestones at two scales, a high level set of key milestones like integration and minimal viable game, and a low level set of weekly milestones.</p>
